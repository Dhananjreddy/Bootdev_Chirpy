# Chirpy

Chirpy is a lightweight Go-based backend that powers a simple microblogging platform where users can register, log in, and post short “chirps.”
Built as a learning project, it demonstrates production-ready backend design with:

Clean, modular Go architecture using the standard net/http library

Secure password hashing via Argon2id

JWT authentication with rotating refresh tokens

Type-safe PostgreSQL queries generated using sqlc

Environment-driven configuration and readiness checks for deploys

Chirpy is ideal for learners and developers who want to understand real-world Go web development, authentication flows, and database integration in a concise, extensible project.
